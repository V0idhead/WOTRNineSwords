#Nine Swords
A mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous implementing the classes found in the Tome of Battle: Nine Swords supplement (https://dndtools.net/rulebooks/supplementals-35--5/tome-of-battle-the-book-of-nine-swords--88/)
There were some changes necessery both to adapt to the Pathfinder ruleset as well as accomodate Wrath of the Righteous

##Contents
 - Warblade class
 - 52 Maneuvers (including a tiny number of Boosts) and 10 Stances from the Diamond Mind, Iron Heart, Stone Dragon, Tiger Claw and White Raven disciplines

##Deviations from Rules as Written
###Spontanous preperation
Instead of having to prepare maneuvers ahead of time as a wizard would, all classes will have all known maneuvers available at all times as a sorcerer does, the number of known and available maneuvers was not changed. This is way less work to implement and makes the classes more flexible.

###Individual Maneuvers
 - Maneuvers that should give your allies an attack bonus against an individual enemy, instead lowers the targets natural armor
 - Stances that say they end when moving more than 5 feet do not have this limitation
 - Hunter's Sense: gives blindsense analogous to other WOTR abilities that are described as "Scent"
 - Steel Wind: doesn't let you choose targets, the game will choose two targets and attack those
 - Flesh Ripper: penalties last for 1 minute instead of being dynamic
 - Bounding Assault: Teleports to target as a swift action
 - Overwhelming Mountain Strike and Irresistible Mountain Strike: staggers target instead of disabling move action
 - Hearing the Air: giving blindsight to disinguish it more from the lvl1 Hunter's Sense
 - Scything Blade: doesn't require having made a successfull attack

##Roadmap
 - Swordsage class
 - Disciplines available to Swordsage
 - Prestige Classes from the Tome of Battle (probably as Archetypes for the two classes in order to Pathfinderfy them)
 - Classes and Maneuvers from the Path of War (https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/path-of-war/), probably I'll fold the Maneuvers into the disciples from Path of War
 - Homebrew Maneuvers to fill out any remaining gaps in the Maneuver-List because some Maneuvers in the book cannot be implemented or would not be useful in WOTR
